# File Upload and Download App

This is a simple React app that allows users to upload and download files from a backend server. It provides the functionality to:
- Select a file and upload it to the server.
- Download an uploaded file by providing its unique ID.
- View a list of all uploaded files.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload files to the backend server using the `POST` method with `multipart/form-data`.
- **File Download**: Download a file by entering its file ID.
- **Display Uploaded Files**: View a list of all uploaded files with their names and unique IDs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (for API), Multer (for file handling)
- **Environment Variables**: React app uses `.env` file to store the backend API URL.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A backend server running that handles file uploads and downloads.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-upload-download-app.git
cd file-upload-download-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies for the frontend:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your backend API URL like this:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:5000"  # or the production URL
```

2. Click the "Upload" button to upload the selected file to the server.
3. If the file is uploaded successfully, the file details (ID and name) will be displayed.

### Downloading Files

1. Enter the file ID in the input field.
2. Click the "Download" button to download the file by its ID.
3. The file will be automatically downloaded to your computer.

### View Uploaded Files

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your backend server is running and properly configured to handle file uploads and downloads.
- Make sure CORS is enabled on the backend if you're working with a different frontend and backend origin.
- If the file upload fails, check the server logs for more information.
